<h1> Primehack Control Configs :] </h1>

<p> These are my controller config files for the program called <a href="https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-fork-primehack-fps-controls-and-more-for-metroid-prime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PrimeHack</a></p>

!!! PLS READ: this was primarily configured for my xbox one S controller. Depending on button layouts, it may be different for you if you choose to use a different controller type (playstation, nintendo, 8bitdo, etc). It can still be used as a basis, though it might require some manual tweaking. Just 

Just simply download the files, and place them inside your dolphin Wiimote folder. If you dont know how to get to that directory, do the following: (Ive only done this on windows, results may vary)
1. Open primehack
2. click on the "File" tab in the top left.
3. click "Open User Folder"
4. open the "Config" folder
5. then, open the "Profiles" folder
6. finally, open the "WiiMote" folder
7. place the .ini files here.

<h2> Loading the files </h2>
<ol>
<li> Connect your desired controller </li>
<li> click on "Controllers" in the main PrimeHack Menu </li>
<li> Ensure the "Emulate the Wii's Bluetooth adapter" bubble is clicked, with the option "Metroid (Wii Remote) is selected. </li>
<li> Then, hit the "Configure" box next to it. </li>
<li> Your screen should look like the one below. First, ensure the controller you are using is the one selected. Go to the top left, and from the drop down menu, select it. </li>
<li> In the top right you will see a "Profile box" - click the drop down menu and select "primecontrols". </li>
<li> click "Load". I repeat this on start up each time. Ive found sometimes not all my controls will load if I dont, so get used to doing this lol. </li>
<li> you're done! the controls should look something like this: </li>
<li> Since you have a different controller then mine, I would recommend recalibrating the movement sticks. Just click "Calibrate" and spin your sticks around. </li>
<li> deadzones are set to those percentages because if you dont, the "look" controls like its on ice. Before you start, I would make sure you have a deadzone that encompasses your entire "aim point", like it does in the screenshot. Otherwise you might get problems. </li>
</ol>

<h2> Some general tips when using these controls: </h2>
1. because "A" is mapped to RT (right trigger) for firing, this means you will also be using the right trigger to interact with everything else, such as forwarding dialogue, or having Samus press a button, etc.

2. Prime 3 was specifically designed to use motion controls, where as Prime 1 / 2 had motion controls added in after the fact. You'll encounter motion control mini games in Prime 3 where the game will tell you to twist the nunchuk a certain way. Obviously, that wont work lol. Just pull the left stick back the entire time - that usually works for me and honestly makes things simpler.
