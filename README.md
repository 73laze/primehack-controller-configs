<h1> Primehack Control Configs </h1>

These are my controller config files for the program called Primehack, which you can find here --> https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-fork-primehack-fps-controls-and-more-for-metroid-prime
--!! this was primarily configured for my xbox one S controller. Depending on button layouts, it may be different for you if you choose to use a different controller type (playstation, nintendo, 8bitdo, etc). !!--

Just simply download the files, and place them inside your dolphin Wiimote folder. If you dont know how to get to that directory, do the following: (Ive only done this on windows, results may vary)
1. Open primehack
2. click on the "File" tab in the top left.
3. click "Open User Folder"
4. open the "Config" folder
5. then, open the "Profiles" folder
6. finally, open the "WiiMote" folder
7. place the .ini files here.

Some general tips when using these controls:
1. because "A" is mapped to RT (right trigger) for firing, this means you will also be using the right trigger to interact with everything else, such as forwarding dialogue, or having Samus press a button, etc.

2. Prime 3 was specifically designed to use motion controls, where as Prime 1 / 2 had motion controls added in after the fact. You'll encounter motion control mini games in Prime 3 where the game will tell you to twist the nunchuk a certain way. Obviously, that wont work lol. Just pull the left stick back the entire time - that usually works for me and honestly makes things simpler.
